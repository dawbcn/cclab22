    <div><p>This game is quite simple. Simply imagine what "world" you would like to create by using the control panel on the right. Each button activates/deactivates whichever feature is displayed. (If you click the rain button it will start to rain, if you click the thunder button lighting will appear, etc.) Test your imagination and start editing your world! </p></div>
