    <div><p>Bouncy Colorfull Ball is a generative art projet which depicts the geometric and mesmerizing nature of a bouncing ball. By making the ball switch colors everytime it touches the edge of the canvas I was able to create an intriguing set of patterns and shapes. This project is a demonstration of the artistic capabilities of certain simple phenomena such as a bouncing ball which can turn out to be interesting art pieces. </p></div>
